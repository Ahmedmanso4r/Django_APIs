# Django_APIs ðŸš€

This repository contains a collection of Django-based API projects, showcasing various implementations of RESTful APIs using Django and Django REST Framework. Below is an overview of the repository, its structure, and how to set it up.

## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the development of APIs using Django and Django REST Framework. It includes multiple API projects, each focusing on different aspects of API development, such as CRUD operations, authentication, and serialization. The projects are designed to be modular and serve as a reference for building scalable APIs.

## âœ¨ Key Features

RESTful API design with Django REST Framework
User authentication and authorization
CRUD operations for various models
Pagination, filtering, and search capabilities
Token-based authentication (JWT or similar)
Example projects for different use cases

## Technologies Used

Python: Programming language
Django: Web framework
Django REST Framework: Toolkit for building APIs
PostgreSQL: Database (configurable)
Docker: Optional containerization
JWT: For authentication (if applicable)

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Ahmedmanso4r/Django_APIs.git
cd Django_APIs

Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure the database: Update the DATABASES setting in settings.py to match your database configuration (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite).
Apply migrations:
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Run the development server:
python manage.py runserver
Access the API: Open your browser or API client (e.g., Postman) and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

## Usage

The repository contains multiple Django projects or apps, each with its own API endpoints.
Use an API client like Postman or cURL to test the endpoints.
Authentication may be required for certain endpoints (refer to specific project documentation).

## API Endpoints

The specific endpoints depend on the project or app within the repository. Common endpoints include:

GET /api/: List resources

POST /api/: Create a new resource

GET /api/<id>/: Retrieve a specific resource

PUT /api/<id>/: Update a specific resource

DELETE /api/<id>/: Delete a specific resource

Refer to the individual project folders or API documentation (e.g., Swagger, if included) for detailed endpoint information.
